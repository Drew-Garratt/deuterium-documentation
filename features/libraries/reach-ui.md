# Reach UI

## Introduction

Reach provides a selection of battle tested accesible components for React.

> Each component is tested with Safari + VoiceOver, Firefox + NVDA, and Edge + JAWS. As the project matures weâ€™ll get it audited by WebAIM to ensure that if you pick Reach UI, your app has a solid, accessible foundation.

As each component can be indidividually imported from the library it strongly encourage that these be added to the package and imported into the application only where required.



## Further Reading

It is strongly encouraged that developers familiarise themselves with the components available as part of the Reach library
