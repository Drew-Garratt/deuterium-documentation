# XState

### Introduction

XState provides us with a predictable, visual and extensible way to build complex logic into the state of our application. It does this by utilising two fundamental computing concepts; finite state machines and statecharts.

#### Finite state machines

A finite state machine is a mathematical model of computation that describes the behaviour of a system that can be in only one state at any given time. For example, let's say you can be represented by a state machine with a finite number (2) of states: `asleep` or `awake`. At any given time, you're either `asleep` or `awake`. It is impossible for you to be both `asleep` and `awake` at the same time, and it is impossible for you to be neither `asleep` nor `awake`.

#### Statecharts

Statecharts are a formalism for modeling stateful, reactive systems. Computer scientist David Harel presented this formalism as an extension to state machines in his 1987 paper [Statecharts: A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems (opens new window)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167642387900359/pdf).
